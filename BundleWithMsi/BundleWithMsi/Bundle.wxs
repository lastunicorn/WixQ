        The bootstrapper application is the one that runs the whole bundle.
        By providing a custom bootstrapper application, it allows to control different details
        of the bundle's run. It also displays the GUI.
        The one used in this demo displays a single page in GUI containing the license agreement.
        By default, the license agreement text is a dummy one.

        Step 1: The .msi files
        ====================================================================================
        
        Make sure you have the msi files. Alternatively, if the WiX projects that generates the
        .msi files are included in the current Visual Studio solution, reference them.
        (Right-click on the bundle project -> Add -> Reference)
        
        In this tutorial, we have two WiX projects `Installer1` and `Installer2` that builds the
        two msi files.

            Step 2: Add the two .msi files in the chain
            ====================================================================================
            
            If the two .msi files are obtained as the result of WiX projects, as in this tutorial,
            there can be used the variables `TargetDir` and `TargetName` to obtain the path to the
            files.
            
            If the .msi files are already built, the full or relative path must be specified instead.
            
            The bundle will install them in order in which they are specified.
            
            The two .msi files are two normal installers that can be also installed independently.
