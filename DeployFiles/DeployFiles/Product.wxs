        The <Feature> element is packing multiple components that can be installed together as a logical piece.
        If the installer has a UI, the user can select independently the features that wants to be installed.
        
        The current installer has only one feature and no UI. The feature will be automatically installed.
        
        If the installer has a UI, the Title attribute contains the text displayed in the UI for the feature.
        The Level attribute should be set to 1 to enable the installation of the feature by default.
