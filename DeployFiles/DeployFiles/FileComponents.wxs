            The component element describes a set of resources (usually files, registry entries, and shortcuts)
            that need to be installed as a single unit.
            Components play a critical role when you decide to build patches later.

                In general, you should restrict yourself to a single file per component.
                The Windows Installer is designed to support thousands of components in a single installer,
                so unless you have a very good reason, keep to one file per component. 
                
                In the repair process, only the main file of the component can be repaired.

                <!--
                The Source attribute specifies the location of the file on your machine, so WiX can find it and build it into the installer.

                <!--
                The KeyPath attribute is set to yes to tell the Windows Installer that this particular file should be used to determine whether the component is installed.
                If you do not set the KeyPath attribute, WiX will look at the child elements under the component in sequential order and try to automatically select one of them as a key path.
                Allowing WiX to automatically select a key path can be dangerous because adding or removing child elements under the component can inadvertently cause the key path to change,
                which can lead to installation problems.
                In general, you should always set the KeyPath attribute to yes to ensure that the key path will not inadvertently change if you update your setup authoring in the future.

                The Checksum attribute should be set to yes for executable files that have a checksum value in the file header (this is generally true for all executables),
                and is used by the Windows Installer to verify the validity of the file on re-install.
