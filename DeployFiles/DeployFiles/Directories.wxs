        This section describes the directory structure that is needed on the target machine.
        To improve the readability of the WiX file, it is a good practice to define the installation directories
        separate of the section where there are listed the files to be deployed.

        The element with the id TARGETDIR is required by the Windows Installer and is the root of all directory structures of the installation.
        Every WiX project will have this directory element.

            The second element, with the id ProgramFilesFolder, uses a pre-defined Windows Installer property
            to reference the Program Files folder on the user's machine.
