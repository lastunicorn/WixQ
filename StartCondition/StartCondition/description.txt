StartCondition
==============================================================================

Q: How to add a start contition?

We will add a start condition that will stop the installation in half of the times, when the current date time (as ticks) is an odd number.

Note: Run the installer multiple times: install, uninstall, install, uninstall, etc... until the condition is happening to be false and the installation is interrupted.
The invalid condition should happen after a couple of installs, unless you leave in a really odd univers in which an odd date time (ticks) value is never happening :)))
