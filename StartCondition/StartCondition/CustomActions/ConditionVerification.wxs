        Note the "Execute" attribute. It is set to "firstSequence".
        This means that, if the custom action is scheduled to run multiple times, it will really run only the first time.
        And it is very useful, because we indeed scheduled the custom action twice:
            - once in client side
            - and a second time in server side.
        Having the "firstSequence" set, it will run only in client side when the installer is started with GUI
        and only in server side when the installer is started without GUI (quiet mode).
